   Back when I was a kid I was always fasinated with technology. The way it worked, how everything was being integrated onto the web, how it was starting to become something we used everyday all of it. It got to the point where as I was growing up I'd say early teens, that I was starting to take them apart to see how they worked. You might think that because I was taking them apart that I would have wanted to get into working with hardware but no, what was the most interesting to me was the way computers worked WITH all the parts and how it showed us everything. I started to look into the ways that the computer would allow us, the users, operate the applications and I stumbled upon programming. when I was about 15 I started looking at different programming languages and software to use to learn what I wanted and how to make things that people would use. Eventually I found myself working with Java, it was difficult for sure but I was on and off learning how it worked and operated to the point that I was proficent in the basics and some advanced concepts. Now you might think why would that make you want to learn Data Science, well as I was learning how to program I just kept getting road blocked by the fact that there is so much information around us, even at that time, that it is probably one of the best places to dive in and get my hands dirty. 

   I eventually realized that for anything worth while, whether it was for a job or for fun data science would be the way to go. You get the challenge of trying to figure out the programming as well as get to see your results right in front of you. It could be as simple as trying to find out how much taxes would be taken out of your paycheck or as difficult as trying to find information based on the best football players nationwide. It is an extremely versitle job since anything and everything is data even if you think it is not.
